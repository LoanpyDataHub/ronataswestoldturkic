# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data of the dataset from which the
CLDF dataset in [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.

Page numbers of entries are not provided. Entries must be looked up through the index that is provided at the end of the monograph.

Omitted following entries:

*GYARMAT: The etymology ("dʹårmåt < H GN < H tribal name Gyarmat") doesn't reference West Old Turkic.

*TÁBOR: They etymology ("tābor < *tabur ← MT tabur ‘army, military camp’
< *tabgur < *tabkur ← Mo dabkur") doesn't reference West Old Turkic.

*TENG: See "tengődik". The headword "teng" itself was omitted, because it is derived from "tengődik", which was eventually loaned from WOT *täŋ-. ("tengȫdik- < teng- {with suffs -Ōd-ik} < *teng- ← WOT *täŋ-")
