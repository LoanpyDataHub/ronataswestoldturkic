# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data of the dataset from which the
CLDF dataset in [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.

Page numbers of entries are not provided. Entries must be looked up through the index that is provided at the end of the monograph.

Omitted entries:

* GYARMAT: The etymology ("dʹårmåt < H GN < H tribal name Gyarmat") doesn't reference West Old Turkic.

* TÁBOR: The etymology ("tābor < *tabur ← MT tabur ‘army, military camp’
< *tabgur < *tabkur ← Mo dabkur") doesn't reference West Old Turkic.

* TENG: I added "tengődik" instead, since the full etymology is "tengȫdik- < teng- {with suffs -Ōd-ik} < *teng- ← WOT *täŋ-"

Quotes:

* p.1005: "Berta suggested a T starting point for the word. However, its first documented appearance is fr the mid-17th c. – certainly a weak point in a T etymology." -- This underpins the notion that the column "year" can be used to filter out improbable etymologies.
