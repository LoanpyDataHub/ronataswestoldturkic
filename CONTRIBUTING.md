# Contributing to the Hungarian Etymological CLDF Dataset

Thank you for considering to contribute to our Hungarian etymological data project! This project aims to convert the data from the etymological dictionary [West Old Turkic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13577601-west-old-turkic) (RÃ³na-Tas and Berta 2011) into the CLDF format. It contains modern Hungarian words as headwords, together with their documented and reconstructed ancestor forms, including their West Old Turkic donor words. West Old Turkic, also called [Proto-Bolgar](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/bolg1249), is the parent language of the western branch of Turkic languages. The raw data contains only a small fraction of the contents of the dictionary yet, so there is plenty of work left to do!

## How to Contribute

We have only converted a fraction of the data from the PDF dictionary to the CLDF format. If you are passionate about PDF-wrangling, Mongolic, Turkic, or Finno-Ugric languages, and want to help expand this dataset, follow the steps below:
