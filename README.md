This dataset is licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license

## Notes

The data used here was extracted from a privately owned PDF-file that can not be shared for copyright reasons. It was converted by copy-and-pasting its content to a .txt-file (after the OCR and pypdf2 had failed). There were several scripts run over over this text-file, which are provided in raw/misc/create_raw. Sometimes, tedious manual editing steps were carried out in between two scripts, so the result can not be produced by simply running the scripts.
