pink, several kinds of pink, Danthus, D. caryophyllus, several members of the Caryophillaceæ	on p. 501 the headword is "KARAMBÉL [kåråmbēl]" but the etymology reads "kårånbēl < *karampil ← Cum *karampil, karamfil". I assumed the form with "n" is a typo, since typically an /n/ would assimilate to /m/ before /b/ and the donor word itself contains an /m/ as well.
secretion, mucus discharged from the eyes	according to the corrigenda-section on p. 1494 I changed "čapa ← WOT *čapaγ" to "čapa < *čapaγ ← WOT *čapaγ"
