pink, several kinds of pink, Danthus, D. caryophyllus, several members of the Caryophillaceæ	on p. 501 the headword is "KARAMBÉL [kåråmbēl]" but the etymology reads "kårånbēl < *karampil ← Cum *karampil, karamfil". I assumed the form with "n" is a typo, since typically an /n/ would assimilate to /m/ before /b/ and the donor word itself contains an /m/ as well.
secretion, mucus discharged from the eyes	according to the corrigenda-section on p. 1494 I changed "čapa ← WOT *čapaγ" to "čapa < *čapaγ ← WOT *čapaγ"
candle	according to the corrigenda-section on p. 1494 I changed "dʹertʹå < *ǰarta ← WOT *ǰarta" to "dʹertʹå < *ǰarta ← WOT *yarta"
hornbeam, Carpinus betulus	according to the corrigenda-section on p. 1494 I changed "dʹertʹān < *ǰartān < *ǰartaγan ← WOT *ǰartaγan" to "dʹertʹān < *ǰartān < *ǰartaγan ← WOT *yartaγan"
word, biblical word, verb	On p. 439 the etymology reads "ige < *üge ← *ügä". I assumed this must be in fact "ige < *üge ← WOT *ügä"
Ismaelite, name of an ethnic group in Medieval Hungary	On p. 177 the etymology reads "bösörmēń < *besermen ← *besermen" I assumed this must be in fact "bösörmēń < *besermen ← WOT *besermen"
charm	The entry "bűbáj" on p. 190 is omitted from the dataset because compounding ("bű+báj") happened only in Hungarian. Therefore, there is no counterpart to be aligned with in West Old Turkic. For the etymology of "bű" one is supposed to look up "bűvös" or "bölcs". The former seems to be lacking from the dictionary, and the latter doesn't explain the etymology of "bű".
